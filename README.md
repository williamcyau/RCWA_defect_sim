# RCWA Defect Simulation

A rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) based simulation tool for modeling electric field distributions and light intensity patterns when plane waves interact with line/space gratings containing customizable defects.

## Features

- **RCWA Framework**: Rigorous electromagnetic solver for periodic grating structures
- **Defect Customization**: Define and simulate localized defects in grating patterns
- **Field Analysis**: Calculate electric field distributions across the structure
- **Grating Orders**: Predict light intensity for different diffraction orders
- **Flexible Parameters**: Adjust wavelength, grating period, duty cycle, and material properties

## Use Cases

- Photomask defect analysis
- Lithography process modeling
- Diffractive optics design
- Pattern fidelity assessment
